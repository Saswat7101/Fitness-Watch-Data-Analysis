# Fitness-Watch-Data-Analysis
**Fitness Watch Data Analysis** involves analyzing the data collected by fitness wearables or smartwatches to gain insights into users’ health and activity patterns. These devices track metrics like steps taken, energy burned, walking speed, and more.

**Fitness Watch Data Analysis** is a crucial tool for businesses in the health and wellness domain. By analyzing user data from fitness wearables, companies can understand user behaviour, offer personalized solutions, and contribute to improving users’ overall health and well-being.

## Key Features:

- **Data Extraction:** Tools and scripts for extracting fitness data from various popular fitness watch models.
- **Data Cleaning:** Python scripts to preprocess and clean raw fitness data for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Create informative and interactive visualizations to better understand your fitness progress.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Perform statistical tests and analysis to uncover patterns and trends in your fitness data.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive notebooks showcasing step-by-step analysis and insights.

## About the Dataset: 

### [Download the Dataset](https://statso.io/fitness-data-analysis-case-study/)

Fitness data analysis involves looking at information about your physical activities and health to understand how your body is performing. This information might come from things like fitness apps, wearables like smartwatches, or records you keep yourself.

The dataset consists of fitness-related metrics collected through a fitness watch over multiple days. Each record in the dataset includes the following attributes:

1. **Date:** The date when the data was recorded.
2. **Time:** The time at which the data was recorded.
3. **Step Count:** The number of steps taken during the recorded interval.
4. **Distance:** The distance covered in meters during the recorded interval.
5. **Energy Burned:** The amount of energy burned in kilocalories during the recorded interval.
6. **Flights Climbed:** The number of flights of stairs climbed during the recorded interval.
7. **Walking Double Support Percentage:** The percentage of time both feet are in contact with the ground while walking.
8. **Walking Speed:** The walking speed in meters per second during the recorded interval.

## Objectives:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution, trends, and patterns of each fitness metric.
- Create visualizations to depict how different metrics vary over time, across different time intervals, or in relation to one another.
- Analyze how step count, distance, energy burned, and other metrics correlate with each other.
- Identify potential patterns in walking efficiency, energy expenditure, and the relationship between step count and walking speed.
- Segment the data into time intervals (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening) based on the recorded timestamps.
- Investigate variations in fitness metrics (e.g., step count, walking speed) during different time intervals.
